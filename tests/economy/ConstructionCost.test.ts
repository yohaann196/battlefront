// Regression test: the ghost/build-menu price of a structure must not double-count
// a player's first structure while it is still under construction.
//
// The cost scales as 2^(units built) * base: 1st city 125k, 2nd 250k, 3rd 500k.
// Cost uses Math.min(unitsOwned, unitsConstructed) so CAPTURED units (owned but
// not built) don't inflate the price. unitsConstructed used to also loop over
// under-construction units, double-counting them and defeating that Math.min —
// a captured city plus a first city under construction showed 500k (3rd-city
// price) instead of 250k.
